# PHP Project
Here you can find all the needed files to run the project:

adminlogin.php - this is admin login form 
adminpanel.php - this is a webpage that contains required information about current orders. As well, you can get access to updating information and status of each order
basicinputresponse.php - this is a response with all information needed after registration*
hello.php - this is a registration form
home.php - this is a user panel, where user can check his order and all the information
index.html - homepage
loginform.php - this is user login form
phpconnect.php - connection to database
update-process.php - this is a page where admin can update information about the order

*Currently you can get your password and ID only after registration. Originally it was planned to make an emailer, but looks like it is not possible to make through services we are using.
